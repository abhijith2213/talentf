# TALENTF (SocialMedia along with job features)

TALENTF is an socialmedia website , which can have two types of 
accounts (freelancers and client). The difference between both 
is that if someone sigin as a freelancers he can see the jobs which
a client has posted , who the freelancers follows. So if the freelancersis interested interested
in the work then he can send the connection request to the client. So client can accept
the one who he likes to assign the work and can chat the remaining parts. And also have
other socialmedia features like, add post, like, comment etc..
